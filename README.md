# Pulse Manager 🫀
This is software to control a pulse duplicator using a Raspberry Pi.  

## Setup 
This project requires python and [eel](https://github.com/python-eel/Eel?tab=readme-ov-file#eel) to be installed on the RPi.  
The project also uses [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/) (no installation required -- a CDN is used.)  

After cloning the project, run it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benholland1024/pulse-manager.git
cd pulse-manager
python app.py
```

## What is a pulse duplicator?
A pulse duplicator is a device used to duplicate the pulsing flow of the human heart. It's used to research the conditions of heart disease.  
Some examples are described in [this paper](https://scholar.sun.ac.za/server/api/core/bitstreams/bccb60ab-9c5d-49c6-a285-ae7c1f789fe6/content), among others.
